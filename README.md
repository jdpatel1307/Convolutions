# Image Classification

This project showcases the power of NumPy in building image filters and pooling operations from scratch. By diving deep into the fundamentals of image processing, we've crafted custom filters and pooling techniques that provide an in-depth understanding of these operations. But it doesn't stop there â€” after applying these operations to images, we harnessed the insights gained to train robust machine learning models. Specifically, we employed Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms to leverage the transformed image data for predictive tasks. This project not only demonstrates the versatility of NumPy but also illustrates how image processing techniques can enhance machine learning workflows, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in computer vision and data-driven decision-making.

### Dataset
The core of this project relies on the scikit-learn digits dataset, a widely used collection of hand-written digit images. This dataset comprises 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), making it a popular choice for digit recognition tasks. Each image is represented as an 8x8 matrix of grayscale values.

### Popular filters used in this project:
1. Gaussian Filter
2. Scharr Filter
3. Sharpening Filter
4. Vertical Edge Filter
5. Horizontal Edge Filter

### Pooling methods used in this project:
1. Max Pooling
2. Min Pooling
3. Mean Pooling
4. Median Pooling
