# Convolutions

This project uses NumPy to create Image filters are created from scratch. Besides, pooling operations are created using the same approach. 
Different filters and pooling operations are tested on the MNIST Dataset in order to classify the images. T
After applying appropriate filters and pooling operations, Random Forest and XGBoost are trained.
